# Pneumonia Detection Model
:  📊 This project implements a deep learning–based pneumonia detection system using chest X-ray images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning was trained on a curated dataset of labeled radiographs to classify images as pneumonia-positive or normal. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation using clinically relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. The project emphasizes model performance, generalization, and interpretability through confusion matrices and visual analysis, demonstrating the practical application of computer vision in medical imaging diagnostics.
